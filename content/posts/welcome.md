We renamed from Docker-NAS to avoid any copyright issues with docker. Thanks to the previous owner of LochNAS we were able to grab lochnas.com to start fresh.

We renamed the project repos which requires you to move your install from /docker-nas to /lochnas.

We created this beautiful site thanks to a theme called blowfish and some logo design by our friends on [fiverr](http://www.fiverr.com/s2/13cdd9dc21).

Our development has moved into the cloud for accellerated growth and we dont have to work on our own installs.

We have many plans for the future shown on our github issues list and hope you can join us for the ride.
